<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Music Visualizer is a VanillaJS application created using p5js library, which provides users with visual input based on mathematical formulaslike the rhodonea curve while they are listening to their music/audio. P5js provided FFT (Fast Fourier Transform), which were used to process and draw the waveform of the audio. Not only do the application comes with the waveform visualization, it also includes a background and particles that are responsive to the amplitude of a given sound.
